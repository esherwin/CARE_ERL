# CARE_ERL
Code accompanying the Sherwin &amp; Azevedo analysis of the California Alternate Rates for Energy program, published in 2020 in Environmental Research Letters.

The Build_datasets_regressions folder contains code to create STATA panel datasets for regression analysis (based on underlying data that we cannot share due to a nondisclosure agreement) as well as the code for regressions and summary statistics used in the paper, the results of which are presented in Excel spreadsheet format.

The Create_main_figures folder includes the data and code for the main figures in the paper, the plot of intra-day variability in the increase in electricity consumption associated with CARE and the externality plot.

“CARE externality analysis 20200708.ana” is an Analytica model that converts regression results into estimates of peak electricity demand, climate, and human health externalities. The model is structured with what should be a relatively user-friendly interface and its code is structured as an influence diagram with internal documentation. To read the model, please download Analytica Free 101 on a Windows machine. https://lumina.com/products/free101/
